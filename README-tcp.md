# Tech Challenge Platform - Building & Deploying Apps

Welcome to the Tech Challenge Platform, which provides a way to quickly create comprehensive, realistic starter applications in a standardized way. It allows generation of each major component, from provided configuration.

The components include:

* Front-end
* Back-end
* Deployment Pipelines
* Cloud Infrastructure

It has functionality that includes things often in production applications, including:

* Multi-page forms
* Common UI Controls
* Admin section
* Style and Component Library
* Authentication and Authorization
* Microservices and SPA architecture
* Deployment Pipelines
* Automated tests

The benefits are many, from getting standardized applications created, wired together and deployed quickly, it makes it easier for the tech challenges to do their work. 

* Generate a basic realistic application very quickly
* Standardize architecture and configuration of 
* Less likely to waste time wiring things together and troubleshooting integration issues
* Application templates and reference architectures
* A prepartion tool for tech challanges

## Getting Started

1. Use [xg](https://github.com/excellaco/xg) to generate a Glue repo, and the compoenents you want. Follow its README to specify configuration values, and the code will be generated and even checked into new GitHub repos.

1. Review the new repositories. Read the READMEs to familiarize yourself with the app components and structure, and how to use existing pieces to build a new app.

1. Start up each component of the application with Glue:

    `./run all`
