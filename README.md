# Glue

This is where you run and manage the services that make up the app, from cloning and updating all related repositories, to starting multiple services able to talk to each other.

You can:

* **Clone all repositories** (in the .repos file). If new ones are added it can be run again: `./git-clone-all`. Get onboarding developers running fast.
* **Start up multiple services**: including core services at once, and specified individual services, all on the same network so they can talk
* **Update/pull all repos**
    
## Setup

1. Since running multiple continers locally, add more available memory for Docker to handle many services running locally: `Under Docker > Preferences > Advanced` and set the following: 
Memory: 4 Gb

1. Clone this repo, and cd into it

1. List the names of your repos in the `./.repos` file (if not generated by xg)

1. Clone all the repos by running `./git-clone-all`

    All of the repos you want to work with will be subdirectories and managed by glue like this:

    ```
    glue
    └── repo 1
    └── repo 2
    ...
    └── repo x
    ```

1. Run the needed command, often initially it would be the core services:

    ```
    ./run core                      # Start main services, including database container

    ./run <SERVICE NAME or ALIAS>   # Run a single server

    ./run db                        # Start just a database

    ./git-pull-all                  # Update all of the managed repos
    ```
